## Installation

You can install `bootcamp` straight from GitHub with `devtools`. If you
do not have devtools, install it with:

``` rinstall_devtools
install.packages('devtools')
```

This package also relies on `dplyr`, `ggplot2` and `learnr`. If you
lack, install them with:

``` r
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages('learnr')
```

Finally install `bootcamp` using:

``` r
devtools::install_github('brockk/bootcamp')
```

## Running tutorials

To run an interactive tutorial, run:

``` r
learnr::run_tutorial('intro', package = 'bootcamp')
```

When you are done, kill the browser window. If you are running from
RStudio, click the red Stop button in the Console pane.

Tutorials currently available (i.e.Â valid substitutions for `intro`
above) are:

  - `intro`
  - `folders`
  - `git`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `markdown`

More are coming.

## Running tutorials online

The tutorials are installed on a public RStudio Cloud instance at:

<https://rstudio.cloud/project/454702>

You are free to run them there. Look for the `Run.R` file.

Happy learning. Kristian.
