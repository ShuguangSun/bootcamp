The `bootcamp` R package contains materials written to teach technical skills to new biostatisticians at Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU) at the University of Birmingham. 
Sessions are presented as [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials.
There is an emphasis on methods that use modern statistical approaches and promote repeatable research.

Content includes:

* Folder structure for clinical trial analysis directories;
* Using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* Using [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Using [ggplot2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
* Using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
* Using [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
* Using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages
* Core skills in [Stata](https://www.stata.com/)
* Working with database snapshots
* Analysing repeated measures data with hierarchical models
* Using regression models for sub-group analyses (and how not to do it)
* Using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)
* Using the CRM model for dose-finding

The material was first taught Sep-Dec 2019.
The course will be given again in 2020.
It will probably also grow to take in further topics.

If you use any of these materials or want to do something similar at your institution, please drop a line to kristian.brock@gmail.com.


## Installation
You can install `bootcamp` straight from GitHub with `devtools`.
If you do not have devtools, install it with:

```{rinstall_devtools, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
```

This package also relies on `dplyr`, `ggplot2` and `learnr`.
If you lack, install them with:
```{r install_others, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages('learnr')
```

Finally install `bootcamp` using:

```{r install_bootcamp, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('brockk/bootcamp')
```

## Running tutorials

To run an interactive tutorial, run:

```{r run_example, eval=FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial('intro', package = 'bootcamp')
```

When you are done, kill the browser window.
If you are running from RStudio, click the red Stop button in the Console pane.

Tutorials currently available (i.e. valid substitutions for `intro` above) are:

* `bootcamp`
* `intro`
* `folders`
* `git`
* `ggplot2`
* `markdown`
* `rmarkdown`
* `snapshots`
* `tidyverse`
* `models`
* `repeatedmeasures`
* `subgroups`
* `stan`


## Running tutorials online

The tutorials are installed on a public RStudio Cloud instance at:

https://rstudio.cloud/project/454702

You are free to run them there. 
Look for the `Run.R` file.

Happy learning.
Kristian.
